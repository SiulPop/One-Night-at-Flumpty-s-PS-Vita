# One-Night-at-Flumpty-s-PS-Vita
"Hi! I'm Flumpty Bumpty. I'm an egg. I'm immune to the plot and can transcend time and space. I brought you to this special place so we can be friends. I hope you are good at hiding, because I am coming after you. Have fun!" - Flumpty

Survive till 6 am by avoiding Flumpty and his friends. If you survive the entire night, you will have a new friend! If you don't, well... you'll see.

A conversion to a bubble has been made for the game, and it is now natively functional!
